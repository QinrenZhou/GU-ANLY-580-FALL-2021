    (a) Multinomial Naive Bayes \
    (b) Linear SVM \
    (c) The perceptron \

6. The priciple of maximum likelihood estimation makes which assumptions about a set of observed data $D = \{ \bold{x}^{(1)},y^{(1)}, \dots, \bold{x}^{(M)}, y^{(M)} \}$ (select all that apply): AB

    (a) All $D^{(i)}$ are drawn from the same distribution (i.e., identically distributed) \
    (b) All $D^{(i)}$ are drawn independently \
    (c) The word counts $\bold{x}^{(i)}_{j}$ are all independent conditioned on their class label $y^{(i)}$

    (b) $\forall_{i} \; \text{do}:$ (i) $y^{(i)} \sim Categorical(\boldsymbol{\mu})$, (ii) $\bold{x}^{(i)} \sim Multinomial(\bold{x} | \text{y}=y^{(i)}, \boldsymbol{\phi})$

9. In softmax regression we describe our label as a one-hot vector: $\bold{y} \in \{ 0,1\}^{K}, \sum_{k}\bold{y}_{k} = 1$. What are the following implications of this selection (select all that apply): ABCD

    (a) $\bold{y}$ represents an empirical distribution over $K$ classes \
    (b) The entropy $H(\bold{y})$ of our labels is zero \ 
    (c) Minimizing $NLL(\boldsymbol{\theta} | D)$ equates to minimizing $H(\bold{y}, \; P(\bold{y} | \bold{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta}))$, the cross entropy between our model distribution and the empirical distribution $\bold{y}$ \
    (d) Minimizing $NLL(\boldsymbol{\theta} | D)$ equates to minimizing $D_{KL}(\bold{y} \; || \; P(\bold{y} | \bold{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta}))$, the KL divergence between our model distribution and the empirical distribution $\bold{y}$
